Last weekend, I chnaged out all the lines -- beer and gas -- on my
kegerator.  I used to have reinforced PVC line for the gas side, but
they were just too stiff. I replaced them with 1/4" vinyl.  I had
enough 3/8" tubing to make three beer lines. I also rearranged my
tubing inside the fridge as well.

I kegged a Scottish 70 that I added abotu a pound of sorghum syrup to,
as well.  I used Nottingham, but it has a "yeasty" taste, but that
should fall out in the keg, I hope.  I still have a Dubbel and Amber I
need to keg.
